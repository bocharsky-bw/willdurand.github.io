Hi folks!

A few months ago, I decided to lock [my old blog](http://www.willdurand.fr)
down. Writing in French was interesting but writing in English sounds like a
nice challenge.

That's why I'm starting this new blog, in English (as well-written as possible)
powered by [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), [HTML5
Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/), and hosted by
[GitHub](http://www.github.com).

You'll get the code by browsing the following repository:
[willdurand.github.com](https://github.com/willdurand/willdurand.github.com).

William
