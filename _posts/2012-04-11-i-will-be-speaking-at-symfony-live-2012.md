location: ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland

Heya, I'm glad to announce that I will be speaking at [Symfony Live 2012](http://paris2012.live.symfony.com/) in Paris, on 7-8th of June.

I will speak about [Propel2](http://github.com/propelorm/Propel2), the upcoming version of [Propel ORM](http://www.propelorm.org).
It will probably present the Propel philosophy, how it works in real life, how it's built, and some other parts you will discover.

To be honest, it will be my very first conference talk, so I decided to speak in French.
Even if some people complained about that, I'm not yet comfortable with my English to hold a talk in English.
But, I will write my slides in English. That way, it will be quite easy to understand for people who don't understand French.

Hope to see you there.
