title: Did I Tell You Open Source Was Awesome?
location: Clermont-Fd Area, France

Few months ago, my father gave me a [Karotz](http://www.karotz.com/home) (the new Nabaztag) for my birthday.
In the same time, I started to learn how to write a [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) plugin, and I knew this
kind of rabbit could be programmed.
That's why I decided to write a [Karotz-Plugin](https://github.com/willdurand/Karotz-Plugin).

As an Open Source Software enthusiast, I published my code on GitHub right at the beginning. The plugin was in a work in progress
state, but quite usable. Unfortunately, I was unable to improve it for few weeks.

When I got some free time to work on it, I saw my repository was forked. Surprise! Someone improved my work, and
published it as an [official Jenkins Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Karotz+Plugin).
Wonderful!

So, I pulled the repository, and learnt a lot from the developer who worked on the plugin. Isn't it awesome?
First, my code has been reused. Second, I learnt new things. Oh! And I got an awesome plugin for Jenkins and my Karotz!

To sum up, it's a often really good idea to [open source everything](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2011/11/22/open-source-everything.html),
even if it's a draft, a work in progress, or just an idea. Someone could find this idea awesome, and could work on it.
And thanks to [GitHub](http://www.github.com), to open source something is really really easy :)
